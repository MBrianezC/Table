# Table Project
I'll be putting on game all know about: HTML Tables, Other HTML tags, CSS selectors and specificity, Common CSS properties


Some dificulties I had will be put here:

To write "<>" in your <p> HTML code you need to write &lt to < and &gt to >.

I just add my link to css in the HTML side without being inside the head.
